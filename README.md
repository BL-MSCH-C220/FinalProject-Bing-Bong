# Project Name
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, November 2023

## Theme - Inside Out
How you thought about or interpreted the theme
We wanted to relate it to the pixar characters as different levels for the old popular game flappy bird. We chose the game because the move is also moving in a motion to go in between the tubes and out to survive.

## Game Play
Objective
Game-play instructions
There are two play options, first one is endless gameplay where you can choose any character and play for as long as youd like. The other the option is levels, which immediatley change after a certain amount of tubes are passed through.

## Impediments
Struggles or surprises you encountered during the development of the game
There were sound issues when trying to get it to connetect to the game, but other than that we were able to work well and communicate with one another to accomplish the game look we wanted.

## Implementation
Features
Assets, or resources used
